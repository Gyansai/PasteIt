Paste It by Team BlueRidge
==
Paste It allows users to upload any text to a web server running
[Stikked](https://github.com/claudehohl/Stikked), an open-source "An advanced
and beautiful pastebin written in PHP". By default, Paste It uploads to Team
BlueRidge's [paste server](https://paste.teamblueridge.org).

We are taking advantage of JetBrains' Kotlin for Paste It as of version 6.0.0.

Users can specify:
* A title
